# Conversational Chatbot

Welcome to the repository for a powerful chatbot application built using LangChain, Hugging Face, Flask, and Transformers. This project demonstrates how to create a chatbot that leverages advanced NLP models to provide meaningful and interactive response.

## Overview

This chatbot application integrates several technologies to deliver a robust conversational experience:

LangChain: Manages conversational workflows and maintains context.
Hugging Face Transformers: Provides state-of-the-art NLP models for generating responses.
Flask: Serves as the web framework for handling API requests and responses.


## Features

- Natural Language Understanding: Utilizes pre-trained models from Hugging Face to understand and generate human-like responses.

- Context Management: Maintains conversation context using LangChain for more coherent interactions.

- API Integration: Built with Flask to offer easy integration with other applications or interfaces.
